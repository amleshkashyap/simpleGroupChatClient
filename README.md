* To run on you local, clone the repo, then separately run the client and servers using npm start and nodemon index.js respectively, add your local DB URL and add a bunch of groups and users (not mandatory) before running. Use the application on localhost:3000. Will updated when finalized and provide heroku URL + Atlast integration.
